A 2d simulation game world with simple geometric shapes as the basis for characters and other game world elements. Geometric shapes have different phycsical properties and as a result can have different functions and attributes in our game. The gaming environment is procedurally generated bases on the cellular automata model and have shapes like circles, squares, crosses and triangles which are interacting with each other. Also the shapes are interacting with the environment and have functions like hunt for food, go home, and explore the world.
